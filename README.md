# VENDING MONEY API

### Build and Run Project
- Download Visual Studio 2019 from [Microsoft Visual studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

- Open project folder and Click on the VendingMoney.sln file.

- When open in Visual studio, hit F5 to run the console application. 
### Assumptions Made During Development
- Coins accepted were 10p, 20p,50p and £1 to simplify the calculation for this case.

- As there are no 1p,2p or 5p coins, amount of change was rounded down to nearest 10.

- Calculated change to one decimal point

### Improvements 
Note: But I was off sick for a number of days, so Put this together in just 2days. So due to massive lack of time, there are many improvements I could make to this code. 

- Would have validated a lot more cases in the tests
- Also Would have liked to add more validations to user input
- Handle the cases where it throws exceptions
- Make it run continuosly
- Make it a windows application maybe
